<h1>Music Battle</h1>
<p>This Project was made in Unity with C# as a part of a module called 'Digital Design and Production' (CIS2012). This module was focused on 3D modeling using Blender and the aim of this project was to make game assets and them use them in a simple game made in Unity. I made a very simple fighting game. The only controls are to attack and to emote and the game restarts when one of the players is defeated.</p>

<p>I have added some images of the Objects Created in Blender for this Project</p>-->
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Although I don't have much intention of doing 3D art as a career as I am much more interested in Programming, this project gave me a base level understanding of Blender and how assets are created for games witch I will find useful when working and communicating with artists and technical artists. Additionally, during this module, Melissa Gaskell, a Technical Art Director at D3T, and Chris Hunter, a Lead Artist at D3T, delivered insightful a guest lecture on the 3D asset creation pipeline that is used in the industry.</p>
