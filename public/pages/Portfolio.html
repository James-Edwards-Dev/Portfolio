<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>This the website you are currently on. It serves as my portfolio to host my game dev/coding projects.</p>
<p>The website was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It used Three.js in order to display the 3D model on the home page. The 3D model is a low poly model of myself and was made in blender.</p>
<p>Finally the contact box on the footer of the website has been created using email.js.</p>
